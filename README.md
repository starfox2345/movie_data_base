# MovieDataBase

Welcome to the Movie Data Base!

In this CLI, you can list the titles of the movies within a movies database. 

Upon execution, the program will ask for an input such as your name, what do you want to do next and movies that you would like to know more about. Like, if you wanted to list the titles of the movies and would like to know more about it, then you would enter an input according to what it would like to receive as an input... or else... something will happen... Once you're done doing what you want to do, then simply enter 'e' or 'E" or 'exit' or however style you want it to be to exit the program.

gem 'movie_data_base'

And then execute:

$ bundle or $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:
