# MovieDataBase

Welcome to the Movie Data Base!

In this CLI, you can list the titles of the movies within a movies database. 

Upon execution, the program will ask for an input such as your name, what do you want to do next and movies that you would like to know more about. Like, if you wanted to list the titles of the movies and would like to know more about it, then you would enter an input according to what it would like to receive as an input... or else... something will happen... Once you're done doing what you want to do, then simply enter 'e' or 'E" or 'exit' or however style you want it to be to exit the program.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'movie_data_base'

And then execute:

$ bundle or $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

$ gem install movie_data_base

To run the program, do:
ruby bin/run

## Usage

To start, enter ruby bin/run

The program will prompt you to enter your name.

Next, it will ask if you would like to list the movies or exit

Next, entering 'Y' will prompt you to enter the name of the movie you would like to know more about.

After entering the name of the movie the details of the movie will populate.

Lastly, if you want to exit, simply enter "n" and from the menu, enter "e" to exit the program.
